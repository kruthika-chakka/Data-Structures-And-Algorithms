# Question
Make a single linked list of integers.  
  - There should be at least 15 nodesThe list should not be sorted.
  - Traverse the list.
  - Now sort the list using selection sort - do not use any other sorting algorithm.
    The list should be sorted such that your program unlinks the nodes and relinks them so that they are sorted. (DO NOT SWAP THE VALUES IN THE NODES).
  - Traverse the list again.
Submit the complete code.
A readme file with instructions to compile.
submit each  Screen shot of your program execution.


READ ME:
1. The code had been exceuted in dev c++ IDE. But any other environments shouldn't be a problem
2. When the code is run, the linked list / array is to be created by the user. 
	- Prompts have been given for the same in the following format:
		* To create a linked list: 
			> 1.Add to list / 2.quit prompt is shown when the program is run
			> Create a new node in linked list by giving "1" as input and pressing enter
			> User is then asked to enter the value to be stored in node. Only integers will be accepted.
			> This process will repeat till the user enters "2" as input to quit creating the linked list
