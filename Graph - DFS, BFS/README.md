# Question
1. Create a graph of at least 10 nodes and 20 edges. You may use any representation we have discussed
       Print the nodes and the edges.
2. Do a DFS traversal of the graph.  Print the nodes in the order visited.
3. Do a BFS traversal.  Use the same node to start as in 2 above.

README:
* As soon as the file is run, all the edges of the graph are printed automatically.
* User is then prompted to give the starting vertex for DFS traversal
* DFS traversal is printed
* User is then prompted to give the starting vertex for BFS traversal
* BFS traversal is then printed
