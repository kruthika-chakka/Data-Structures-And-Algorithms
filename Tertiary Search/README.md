Make a single linked list of integers.

  - There should be at least 15 nodesThe list should not be sorted.
  - Traverse the list.
  - Now sort the list using selection sort - do not use any other sorting algorithm.
  - The list should be sorted such that your program unlinks the nodes and relinks them so that they are sorted. (DO NOT SWAP THE VALUES IN THE NODES).
  - Traverse the list again. Submit the complete code. A readme file with instructions to compile. submit each Screen shot of your program execution.

READ ME:

  - The code had been exceuted in dev c++ IDE. But any other environments shouldn't be a problem
  - When the code is run, the linked list / array is to be created by the user.
  - Prompts have been given for the same in the following format:
    * To create an array:
          > The user is prompted to enter the number of elements needed in the array
          > After this, user is to enter the elements of the array
          > Lastly the user is to input the element to be searched
