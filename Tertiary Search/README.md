# Question
  - We covered binary search algorithm for an array. 
  - Write program similar to binary search, but now divide the list into 3 parts each time.  So this would be tertiary search algorithm. 
  - Your program must be recursive
Submit the code and screen shot of executions.
Run it 2 times:
- once try to search a number in the list.
- Second time search a number not in the list.


READ ME:

  - The code had been exceuted in dev c++ IDE. But any other environments shouldn't be a problem
  - When the code is run, the linked list / array is to be created by the user.
  - Prompts have been given for the same in the following format:
    * To create an array:
          > The user is prompted to enter the number of elements needed in the array
          > After this, user is to enter the elements of the array
          > Lastly the user is to input the element to be searched
