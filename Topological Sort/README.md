# Question
	a. Write a program to do DFS topological sort . your program must be able to catch the loop.
		Run the program on the attached graphs.
	b. Write a program to do BFS topological sort . your program must be able to catch the loop.
		Run the program on the attached graphs.
	submit screen shots of execution results.
	submit the code

ReadMe:
	After running the program, user has to input: 
	* No of vertices <press enter>
	* No of edges <press enter>
	* Edges in the format "from_edge <space> to_edge" till all the edges are given
	Then the program checks to see if there is a cycle in the graph entered. 
	* If there is a cycle, program is terminated. 
	* If there is no cycle, user is prompted to enter "1" for DFS topological search and "2" for BFS topological search. <press enter> 
	* Results are then displayed
